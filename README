autoreconf -i
automake -a -c
./configure

```

## Cross-compiling:
This library is designed for use in embedded systems. If you want to cross-compile it, try something along the lines of:
`./configure --build=x86_64-linux-gnu --host=mips-openwrt-linux`

You will need to have the appropriate library and executable search paths in $PATH and $LDFLAGS.
